# pulses21: Barriers and drives for increasing future pulse consumption from a heavy and light consumers perspective in Denmark
This project investigates barriers and drivers for pulse consumption and the intentions to increase future pulses intake through a survey among 596 Danes conducted in 2021.

Analyses for this project are run in the following order:

/data_raw/create_data.R **This has already been run to sort the raw data into the sorted data needed for further analyses** 

/R/data_management.R **This script contains code for data wrangling prior to conducting analyses**

/R/analyses.R **This script contains code for descriptive analyses and logistic regression analyses**

factor_analysis_pulses21.Rmd **This markdown contains code for factor analyses with varimax rotations**

factor_analysis_pulses21.html **This html contains output from factor analyses with varimax rotations**


The /doc/ folder contains output from analyses including result tables, figures, graphs, etc. and a markdown describing the process of conducting factor analyses for heavy and light consumers of pulses.
